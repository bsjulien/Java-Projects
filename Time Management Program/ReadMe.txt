Project Description:

We designed this project in order to help people especially students to effectively manage 
their studies, work and also their day to day life. The project has three categories which
are home, school and work. These categories are basically the type of areas where a typical 
person specifically a student would perform a certain activities. 

When a person decides to record activities in either category, they must input a title,
date, the time when the activity should start(from time) and the time when the activity should
end(to time). The date and time should be written in a strict format provided on the 
user interface. The program also follows a very strict validation process which involves
these rules:

- You cannot put a date that is in the past
- When you've picked the current date, you cannot pick a from time that has already passed
- And finally, you cannot put the to time that is before the from time. 

In addition to the above rules, you cannot submit the form when either one of the fields is 
empty. These rules apply to all categories. 

Finally when you click create, the data adds themselves in the "Created Activities" table in 
all activities tab and the respective category tab. Now the timer starts.

When the from time reaches, the program make a sound and the status column updates itself 
to started. And when the to time reaches, the program makes an alarm like sound and the 
status column updates itself to finished. 


We hope you get a good experience while using our program. Thank you!!
